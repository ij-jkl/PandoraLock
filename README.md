## Overview

PandoraLock provides enterprise-grade security for file management through AES-256-GCM encryption, RSA/ECC key management, and role-based access control. Users can share files privately with fine-grained permissions or make them publicly available via a Redis-powered caching layer, while maintaining complete visibility through tamper-resistant audit logs.

> **Note:** This project is currently under active development and is not yet production-ready. Contributions, design discussions, and feedback are welcome.

## Security Philosophy

**Zero Trust by Design**

PandoraLock operates on the principle that security cannot be an afterthought. Every component is designed with security-first principles:

- **Files are encrypted** before they ever touch storage
- **Cryptographic keys** are managed through secure, industry-standard protocols
- **All actions are logged** in tamper-resistant audit trails
- **Access is verified** at every layer of the system

This approach ensures transparency, accountability, and protection against both external threats and internal vulnerabilities.
